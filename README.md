# Simulation of Wireless Power Transfer System

This project uses Java to provide a basic interface to the simulation of a wireless power transfer system. This project is part of my senior design project for an undergraduate degree in computer engineering, team **Super Beta**.

## Installation

Clone this repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ramo-11/WPT_System.git
```

## Running

You must have make installed in order to run the project

Since the project uses Graphical User Interface (GUI), support for a monitor is required. So running on WSL might cause issues. Powershell, Git Bash, MacOS terminal and other terminals should all be sufficient for running.

Create a jar file
```bash
make jar
```
Run the jar file
```bash
java -jar WPT.jar
```
Alternatively, you could compile and run without using a jar file

To compile and run
```bash
make run
```
